# Image Preprocessing Info and Explanation

## Aspect Ratio Calculation:
- We get the original width and height of the image.
- We determine which dimension is larger and scale the other dimension proportionally to fit within 448 pixels.

# Resizing

- We resize the image using Image.Resampling.LANCZOS for better quality.

# Padding (Optional)

- We create a new black image of size 448x448.
- We paste the resized image into the center of the black image.
- This ensures that all input images are exactly 448x448, which is required by the ONNX model.

# Conversion to NumPy Array

- We convert the image to a NumPy array, normalize the pixel values, and adjust the color channel order.

# Important Considerations

- Padding Color: You can change the padding color by modifying the Image.new("RGB", (448, 448)) line.
- Performance: Padding adds an extra step, which may slightly impact performance.
- Alternative Padding: Alternatives to black padding include mirroring the image edges or using a blurred version of the image for padding.
- Model Performance: Padding can sometimes negatively affect model performance, depending on the model. Test with and without padding to see which produces better results for your use case.
- Cropping instead of padding: Cropping the image to the correct aspect ratio may be a better option than padding, depending on the image content.
